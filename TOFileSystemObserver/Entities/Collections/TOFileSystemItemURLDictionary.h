 A thread-safe dictionary that stores the file paths
 to items using their on-disk UUID string as the key.
 
 This is used to store an in-memory graph of all of the files
 as they were at the start of the app session, so that any
 detected changes to the file system can be compared.
 
 The URLs are converted to and stored as relative URLs to
 save memory, and are converted back to absolute URLs when retrieved.
